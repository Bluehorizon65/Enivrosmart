# Enivrosmart
EnviroSmart represents an innovative leap in home and garden management, combining intelligent IoT systems with real-time environmental sensing to provide insights and automation that enhance efficiency, sustainability, and ease of control.

Equipped with diverse sensors for tracking soil moisture,
temperature, and humidity, EnviroSmart gathers precise
data on garden conditions and enables predictive insights
using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms
analyze soil suitability, guiding users on planting choices
and eco-friendly garden care. A user-friendly mobile app
interface displays this information, enabling remote
monitoring and actionable feedback for users
